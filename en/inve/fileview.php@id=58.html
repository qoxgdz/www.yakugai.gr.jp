<h2>Iressa (Gefitinib)</h2>

<div id="inveArticle"><p>
Iressa (Gefitinib), an orally administered epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was approved for marketing as a non-small cell lung cancer drug in July 2002 in Japan, for the first time in the world.<br />
<br />
Prior to approval, AstraZeneca (AZ), the sales company of Iressa, advertised that the side effects of Iressa were less than other anticancer drugs.<br />
But three months after the approval, the Ministry of Health and Labor (MHLW) of Japan announced an emergency warning report that 26 patients developed interstitial pneumonia, including 13 deaths.<br />
The number of victims increased rapidly, 799 patients died by interstitial pneumonia as of Sep. 2009.<br />
The special survey team reported that the frequency of interstitial pneumonia is 5.8% of those treated with Iressa, and the death rate was 2.5%. <br />
<br />
Iressa was approved on the basis of an effect on a surrogate endpoint  measured by tumor shrinkage, but it has failed to prove the overall survival benefit in as many as 4 superiority trials (INTACT-1 &amp; -2, SWOG, ISEL), in addition to the non-inferiority trial (V15-32) that was required by the Japanese regulatory agency when marketing approval was given to the manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Iressa raises serious concerns about the drug approval process and the way of advertisement developed under the guise of academic information.<br />
And also, it poses a serious problem concerning the conflicts of interest. This is because a lot of members of The Japan Lung Cancer Society Guideline Committee on Gefitinib had a financial relationship with AstraZeneca (AZ).<br />
<br />
